		<h1>Deep Dreams</h1>
		<p>These are the (few) things I've done with Google's Deep Dream project put together in one (shoddy) website.</p>
		<p>There's probably more to come. We'll see.</p>

		<h3>Navigation</h3>
		<p>First, click on one of the links in the top menu bar. Then use the left and right arrow keys to zoom in and out.</p>

		<h3>Warning</h3>
		<p>Moving between images (with the left and right arrows) is <em>very</em> jittery if you haven't looked at the page in a while, or ever. Which, to be honest, probably applies to most people, because why would you frequently look at these weird images?<p>
		<p>The jitteriness goes away if you've cycled through the images once already (at least for me), presumably because the images get cached by your browswer and it's not struggling to load them.</p>
